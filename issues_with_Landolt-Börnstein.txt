2019 Vogt:
- H2I2Si diagram is not as non-planar as Sichao's version of the diagram.
- CFO2 diagram has 1 single and 1 double bond, but the table has two double bonds
- Br2Fe is confusing in many ways. Br...Br would usually indicate Van der Waals interactions, but here it's just the distance between two atoms that are not "bonded". Did they get the distance from vibrational spectroscopy? Then why are they saying they are not bonded (what does it even mean to be bonded)? Also, it's confusing that Br-Br is not double Fe-Br, until you notice that there's also a Br-Fe-Br angle despite the diagram being linear. I didn't notice the footnote next to Dooh until I was already confused. Ideally there would be two separate diagrams, and two separate point groups given with equal font size, rather than C2v just mentioned in a "comment". Dotted line for CH3NOS is extremely confusing!
- H2I2 the dotted line is not the distance given, which confused me. Why no dotted lines for HeN2O?
- CBF3O this seems like it's a Van der Waals complex from the "Lewis formula" but not from the diagram, althoug there's a dotted line when listing bond lengths, but it's like the Br...Br one described in a point above, not the typical Van der Waals dotted line. But dotted line for CH3NOS is extremely confusing!
- Colors for atoms are not conventional?

Kuchitsu?
- D3v point group for GeH3F

- "G6" point group for methane, is actually called "G6 MS", otherwise it's impossible to know what group it is, without reading the original referenced paper (see #group-theory channel in the HPQC Discord server). Also C2H6O2 from 30A.
- "G4" point group: CHIO2 on pg 257 of 30A. Also C2H6KrO and C2H6NeO and C2H6NeS and C2H6S and C2H7ClO from the same book. Also in 28C there's C4H9N which says "G4 (equitorial gauche)" which is confusing: I think the "gauche" part has nothing to do with the G4 part, but I can look into it later.
- "G36" point group: C2H8ArSi from 30A
 - CCl2S on pg 241 of Landolt-Bornstein 30A looks from the diagram to be in Cs but it says the ground state is C2v. Maybe if I had a better intuition for C2v I wouldn't have got so confused, but this really did lead me to a lot of confusion: https://discord.com/channels/929956709542293504/1107534379321933865/1128905475644199003 It would have been better if they had two diagrams, one for C2v and one for Cs. Don't list only 1 point group in the top-right corner, but then give a diagram for another one. 
 - F2O6S2 in 28A has G+G+ whereas C2H6S2Se has g+g+, it's an inconsistency that, for someone like me who didn't know what g+g+ was until a lot of Googling (and still haven't found the answer, but at least know that it's something common enough that a 4th year undergrad chemistry student probably knows it) throws me off and makes me wonder. In fact I'll be asking Hemanth whether or not it's the same, just to make sure. Hemanth said that they're the same, but then I found C4H9FO in 28C which has both G+ and g+. 

It's all un-organized, you need to look at several books and may not know which book at which to look.
